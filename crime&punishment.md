## Part 1

### Relevant Characters
- [Raskolnikov](#char-raskolnikov)
- [Praskovya Pavlovna](#char-praskovya-pavlovna)
- [Alyona Ivanova](#char-alyona-ivanova)
- [Lizaveta Ivanovna](#char-lizaveta-ivanovna)

### Summary
- [Raskolnikov](#char-raskolnikov), a former student, lives in poverty in a tiny, filthy St. Petersburg apartment. He's too broke to continue studying and too proud to accept help. He avoids people — including his friends and his [landlady](#char-praskovya-pavlovna) — out of shame and arrogance. He spends his days lying in bed, wandering the streets, and talking to himself.
- He's intelligent but mentally deteriorating. He toys with the idea an ["Extraordinary Man" theory](#gloss-extraordinary-man-theory), where extraordinary people (like conquerors or great thinkers) have the right to commit crimes — even murder — if it benefits humanity.
- He pawns some of his belongings to [Alyona Ivanovna](#char-alyona-ivanova), whom he despises, seeing her as parasitic and cruel, exploiting the poor for profit. He begins to rationalize that killing her could serve a greater purpose — redistributing her wealth to help others. However, he's unsure if he's "extraordinary" enough to actually go through with it.

### Analysis
- [Raskolnikov](#char-raskolnikov)'s pride isolates him from society. He is too arrogant to accept help. He begins to toy with a dangerous idea where it is acceptable to kill people, like [Alyona Ivanovna](#char-alyona-ivanova) (who he views as a money hoarder and parasite), if it benefits others. This is his growing belief but he is unsure if he is extraordinary enough to actually kill her.


## Part 2
  
Chars
- Marmeladov: A drunken ex-clerk Raskolnikov meets in a tavern.
- Katarina Ivonova: Marmeladov's proud sickly wife.
- Sonya Semyonovna: Marmeladov's daughter who turned to prostitution.

Sum
- Raskolnikov, overwhelmed and spiraling, wanders the streets and ends up in a tavern. He's on the verge of a mental
  breakdown and is completely detached from reality. He observes the shared misery of the poor, feeling disconnected 
  from them despite his own suffering.
- Marmeladov, a pitiful, drunken man, strikes up a conversation with Raskolnikov. He gives a long, emotional monologue 
  about his family's suffering. He admits he's wasting their money on alcohol, while Sonya has been forced into 
  prostitution to keep the family from starving. He speaks of his own guilt and shame but insists that God will forgive 
  Sonya, calling her "holy through suffering."
- Raskolnikov, despite his deteriorating state, feels moved by Marmeladov's misery. He helps him get home, where Katerina 
  Ivanovna lashes out at her drunken husband in front of their hungry children.
- These events force Raskolnikov to confront the raw, human suffering around him — suffering that his cold, logical 
  theories can't easily explain away. The idea of justifying evil for a greater purpose grows stronger in his mind — he 
  wonders if sacrificing one "louse" (Alyona) could save countless "Sonya-like" innocents.
