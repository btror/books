# Crime and Punishment

<i>Crime and Punishment</i> is a 19th century novel by <b>Fyodor Dostoevsky</b> that explores the moral and existential struggles of Raskolnikov, a former student who commits murder to test his theory that extraordinary people are above the law. The novel dives into guilt, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions.

Russian literature is extremely difficult to read and analyze — especially without name tracking and note taking. Hence, this README.

# Part 1 

## Part 1 Chapter 1

### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Alyona
- Lizaveta
- Praskovya

### Terms
- Extraordinary Man Theory

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c1raskolnikov], a former student, lives in poverty in a tiny, filthy St. Petersburg apartment. He's too broke to continue studying and too proud to accept help. He avoids people — including his friends and his landlady, Praskovya[^c1praskovya] — out of shame and arrogance. He spends his days lying in bed, wandering the streets, and talking to himself.
- He's intelligent but mentally deteriorating. He toys with the idea an "Extraordinary Man" theory[^gemt], where extraordinary people (like conquerors or great thinkers) have the right to commit crimes — even murder — if it benefits humanity.
- He pawns some of his belongings to Alyona Ivanovna[^c1alyona], whom he despises, seeing her as parasitic and cruel, exploiting the poor for profit. He begins to rationalize that killing her could serve a greater purpose — redistributing her wealth to help others. However, he's unsure if he's "extraordinary" enough to actually go through with it.

### Analysis
- Raskolnikov[^c1raskolnikov]'s pride isolates him from society. He is too arrogant to accept help. He begins to toy with a dangerous idea where it is acceptable to kill people, like Alyona[^c1alyona](who he views as a money hoarder and parasite), if it benefits others. This is his growing belief but he is unsure if he is extraordinary enough to actually kill her.



## Part 1 Chapter 2
  
### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Marmeladov
- Sonya
- Katarina

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c2raskolnikov], overwhelmed and spiraling, wanders the streets and ends up in a tavern. He's on the verge of a mental breakdown and is completely detached from reality. He observes the shared misery of the poor and working class, feeling disconnected from them despite his own suffering.
- Marmeladov[^c2marmeladov], a pitiful, drunken man, strikes up a conversation with Raskolnikov[^c2raskolnikov]. He gives a long, emotional monologue about his family's suffering. He admits he's wasting their money on alcohol, while Sonya[^c2sonya] has been forced into prostitution to keep the family from starving. He speaks of his own guilt and shame but insists that God will forgive Sonya[^c2sonya], calling her "holy through suffering."
- Raskolnikov[^c2raskolnikov], despite his deteriorating state, feels moved by Marmeladov[^c2marmeladov]'s misery. He helps him get home, where Katarina[^c2katerina] lashes out at her drunken husband in front of their hungry children.

### Analysis
- These events force Raskolnikov[^c2raskolnikov] to confront the raw, human suffering around him — suffering that his cold, logical theories can't easily explain away. The idea of justifying evil for a greater purpose grows stronger in his mind — he wonders if sacrificing one "louse", such as Alyona[^c2alyona], could save countless "Sonya[^c2sonya]-like" innocents.



## Part 1 Chapter 3

### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova
- Dunya
- Luzhin
- Svidrigailov
- Marfa
- Nastasya

### Terms
- Governess
- Extraordinary Man Theory

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova[^c3raskolnikova], informing him of what has been going on in her and Dunya[^c3dunya]'s life. The letter is filled with love and a heavy sense of guilt, sacrifice, and unspoken expectations. She explains Dunya[^c3dunya]'s engagement to Luzhin[^c3luzhin], a wealthy lawyer who is older and unpleasant. Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova[^c3raskolnikova] wants a wife that would feel indebted to him for lifting her and her family out of poverty. The letter paints him as controlling and condescending but his mother tries to spin it in a positive way.
- The letter highlights the events leading up to this. Dunya[^c3dunya] worked as a governess[^ggoverness] for Svidrigailov[^c3svidrigailov], a wealthy landowner, who many people including his wife, Marfa[^c3marfa], believed Dunya[^c3dunya] was seducing and having an affair with. His wife publically humiliated Dunya[^c3dunya] over it, which ultimately hurt her marriage prospects. It turned out that Svidrigailov[^c3svidrigailov] was actually harassing Dunya[^c3dunya]. Marfa[^c3marfa] did clear Dunya[^c3dunya]'s name, but the damage was already done — Luzhin[^c3luzhin] became her only real option.
- It suggests Dunya[^c3dunya] is sacrificing her future for Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov]'s future and emphasizes that she is going through with the marriage to fund his education and give him more opportunities. Dunya[^c3dunya] and her mother are being humiliated for Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov]'s sake, which puts an unbelievable amount of pressure on him to be successful. They're betting everything on him.
- It ends with his mother sending him the little money they had left — reinforcing the self-sacrifice theme. The letter's tone is optomistic, hopeful for the future, but ultimately conveys desperation. It is emotionally manipulative — implying that Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] owes his mother and sister for what they are doing for him, even if he would have never allowed it if he knew and had a say.
- Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] is very pissed. He cries and wanders around the streets.

### Analysis
- This is the third major event that will sway Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] towards actually engaging with his extraordinary man theory[^gemt].
- MAJOR EVENT RECAP
  - Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] pawns his father's watch to a pawnbroker, Alyona[^c3alyona], for a low amount. She's rude and condescending to him. She gives him far less money than the item is worth because she knows he's desperate. A personal injustice.
  - Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] goes to a tavern and encounters an alocholic, Marmeladov[^c3marmeladov], who used to be a clerk and was fired. He explains that his family is impovereished and his daughter, Sonya[^c3sonya], went into prostitution to keep things together. Meanwhile, he's spending all her money on alcohal. Another injustice, especially against the Sonya[^c3sonya].
  - Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov]'s sister, Dunya[^c3dunya], is marrying a cruel older man, Luzhin[^c3luzhin], for Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov]'s sake. She and her mother are suffering for the hope something comes of Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov], however, Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov] quit his studies and does nothing (kind of like Marmeladov[^c3marmeladov], the alcohlic ex-clerk).
- THOUGHT: how will these events influence Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov]'s future actions?
  - This is a great opportunity for introspection on Raskolnikov[^c3raskolnikov]'s part.
    - He could compare the situation with his mother and sister to Marmeladov[^c3marmeladov]'s with his wife and daughter, potentially avoiding going down the self-destructive path Marmeladov[^c3marmeladov] took.
    - On the other hand, he can drown in self-pity and blame the world.
  - These events will push him more into his theory and he will likely do something very stupid.



## Part 1 Chapter 4

### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Dmitri Prokofyevich Razumikhin
- Dunya
- Sonya
- Luzhin
- Svidrigailov

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] is venting and angry that his family didn't ask for his advice.
- He reflects on his sister, Dunya[^c4dunya], describing her as independent and strong — making her marriage to Luzhin[^c4luzhin] feel out of character.
- He compares Dunya[^c4dunya]'s sacrifice to the hardships Sonya[^c4sonya] faces supporting her family financially via prostitution. He pities them and feels guilty.
- Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] notices a young drunk girl stumble her way to a bench. He also spots an older man, in his 30s, stalking her. Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] yells at the man, sarcastically calling him "Svidrigailov[^c4svidrigailov]" (Dunya[^c4dunya]'s former employer), and charges toward him ready to fight.
- A police officer stops Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov]. Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] explains to him that a creep is following her. The police officer is cooperative and tries to help Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] get the girl's address so they can put her in a taxi and send her home and keep her away from the man.
- Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] mocks the police officer out of nowhere, saying that he should leave them alone to "have a good time". The officer is kind of bewildered but continues on to help the girl as they part from Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov].
- Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] spirals into bitter thoughts about the situation. He wonders why he should even care? Why not let them destroy each other? He then pivots to feeling pity for her and imagines the suffering she's going through. His resentment toward Dunya[^c4dunya]'s situation is fueling his cynicism.
- Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] remembers the reason he went out in the first place — to visit his old university friend, Razumikhin, who he views as extremely intelligent and easygoing enough to get along with him, unlike most of the other people at the university. Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov] also notes him as large, strong, and cheerful despite being poor. Razumikhin is good at dealing with tough situations, according to Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov].

### Analysis
- Raskolnikov[^c4raskolnikov]'s encounter with the drunk girl is a microcosm of the duality within him. He's torn between his extraordinary man theory[^gemt] and his instinctive compassion. 
- He bounces between wanting to be a superior man above morality and feeling guilt and hopelessness like the rest of society would. 
- His disgust towards Luzhin[^c4luzhin] and anger over Dunya[^c4dunya]'s future marriage is a personal example of the theme this encounter is hitting. He loves his mother and sister but that love is twisted by pride and resentment. He doesn't want them to suffer without his say.



## Part 1 Chapter 5

### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Marmeladov
- Sonya
- Katarina

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] stumbles into a tavern and unexpectedly runs into Marmeladov[^c5marmeladov], the drunken man he previously met.
- Marmeladov[^c5marmeladov] is in worse shape and begs Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] to take him home. He's scared to face his wife, Katarina[^c5katarina].
- They arrive at his apartment and Katarina[^c5katarina] screams and beats her husband in front of Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] and their children.
- She expresses extreme grief and shame over their daughter's prostitution. Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] gives Katarina[^c5katarina] some money and leaves.
- Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] wanders around for a while and comes across a crowd gathered around someone who was ran over by a carriage. The victim is Marmeladov[^c5marmeladov]. Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] helps carry him home and pays for a doctor and priest.
- Marmeladov[^c5marmeladov] dies with Sonya[^c5sonya] weeping over him and Katarina[^c5katarina] loses her mind.
- Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] goes home and crashes. His mental state is deteriorating more.

### Analysis
- Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] claims to be above morality but he instinctively helped Marmeladov[^c5marmeladov] and his family. His actions highlight his inner conflict.
- This tragedy is an example of self-sacrifice and degradation. Marmeladov[^c5marmeladov]'s family suffers greatly and Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov] can't ignore it.
- Sonya[^c5sonya] is a Christ-like figure who suffers for others. This is deeply unsettling for Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov].
- Raskolnikov[^c5raskolnikov]'s decision to help them shows his subconscious rejection of his "extraordinary man" idea. If he was above morality, why would he care?



## Part 1 Chapter 6

### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Razumikhin
- Alyona
- Lizaveta

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c6raskolnikov] wakes up and is torn by the weight of his thoughts.
- He leaves to meet Razumikhin[^c6razumikhin] but ultimately bails.
- He thinks about the murder he's been planning on Alyona[^c6alyona]. He's convinced that it is morally justified to kill a parasite who exploits people.
- He recalls a conversation he heard in a tavern justifying killing her and redistributing her wealth. This reinforces his extraordinary man theory[^gemt].
- He comes up with a plan to carry out the murder. He thinks Alyona[^c6alyona]'s sister, Lizaveta[^c6lizaveta], won't be around Alyona[^c6alyona] at a specific time which would give him an opening. He also finds a way to conceal an axe under his coat for convenience.
- He eventually leaves his apartment and goes toward Alyona[^c6alyona] to conduct the murder.

### Analysis
- Raskolnikov[^c6raskolnikov] shifts from theorizing to taking action. The murder is no longer an intellectual debate.
- His logic is based on utilitarianism. He convinces himself that he'll use her money for the greater good but really is just driven by his own suffering and pride. He wants to be extraordinary.
- He hates Alyona[^c6alyona] to the point that she's not even human to him. This makes it easier for him to justify going through with it.



## Part 1 Chapter 7

### Characters
- Raskolnikov
- Alyona
- Lizaveta
- Nastasya

### Summary
- Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] reaches Alyona[^c7alyona]'s apartment and knocks on her door. He uses a fake pledge to convince her to let him in.
- Eventually, he strikes her with the axe he was concealing. She falls to the ground and he strikes her again.
- After she's down, Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] goes through her things and doesn't really know what he's doing at that point. He's having trouble logically processing what to do next. It's chaotic.
- Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] never shut the door to Alyona[^c7alyona]'s apartment after entering. Eventually, Lizaveta[^c7lizaveta], Alyona[^c7alyona]'s half-sister, comes in and sees the body. Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov]'s plan assumed that Lizaveta[^c7lizaveta] would not be there at the time he planned to kill Alyona[^c7alyona].
- Raskolnkov impulsively kills Lizaveta[^c7lizaveta] with his axe out of fear then shuts the door. Eventually, he hears two men outside the apartment in the hallway. The men had business with Alyona[^c7alyona] and were knocking on the door and trying to get in, as they expected her to be home at that time and were confused why she wasn't answering.
- At some point they move away briefly to find help, giving Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] an opening to escape. He slips past them and runs down the stairs with his axe and stolen items. The men who were trying to get in noticed the door wasn't locked soon after and find the bodies. They realized that the murderer was in the apartment while they were trying to get in.
- Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] stumbles home and goes through all the stuff he stole and hides them in his apartment. He has blood stains on his clothes and is extremely exhausted. He lays down.
- Nastasya[^c7nastasya], the landlady's servant, comes in to check on Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov]. She notices he's in bad shape and tries to talk to him but he's not very responsive and assumes he's sick. She doesn't notice anything otherwise.

### Analysis
- Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] shifts from thinking about his plan to executing it. He initially thought that he'd be able to carry out what he rationalized to be a swift, noble act for the greater good, in a methedological, calculated manner. The act was more chaotic and sloppy than he anticipated. It really emphasizes how stuck in his head he is. It's similar to how someone that is really good at Call of Duty might think they could pick up a gun and level with Navy Seals, or someone who's never skateboarded before thinks they can do a kickflip after watching a few videos. Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] is not as extraordinary as he thinks he is and has a rosey view of himself. Napolean didn't ride a big white stalion over the alps, it was actually a mule or a donkey.
- Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] shifts from obsessing over his extraordinary man theory[^gemt] and planning his murder to actually carrying it out, the idea being to fulfill a sexier part in his theory where he is an extraordinary figure that can break rules. He imagined that he'd be able to carry it out with precision and clarity — a swift, noble act for the greater good but when the time comes it's sloppy and chaotic, the opposite of how he envisioned. This shows how trapped in his head he was.
  - THOUGHT: This is a similar dynamic to someone playing Call Of Duty all day thinking they can level with Navy Seals in combat (Gravy Seals), or someone who has never skateboarded before thinking they can land a kickflip after watching a few hours of kickflip tutorial videos. Theories, schemes, and ideas are not reality.
  - Raskolnkiv's self-image is a joke. He's not far off from some guy with manboobs flexing in front of a mirror long enough to stop noticing them. He's spent so much time fixating on society's problems that he's trained his mind to see a warped, oversimplified version of reality — one where he's the solution. He sees himself performing a bold, transformative act — like Napoleon crossing the Alps on a majestic white stallion to conquer Europe. The reality is closer to Napoleon riding a mule through the mud, ending with half a million of his men frozen to death in Russia and Napoleon himself exiled to a remote island.
- <b>(GUILT: core theme)</b> Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] justified his actions by reducing Alyona[^c7alyona] to an idea rather than a person. Murdering her was within the bounds of his ideological framework, but when Lizaveta[^c7lizaveta] entered the picture it flpped everything upside down. She's not a symbol, she's a person. Murdering her was reflexive and psychologically fractured him. Murdering Alyona[^c7alyona] was supposed to be a logical act, but Lizaveta[^c7lizaveta]'s death makes him feel extremely guilty.
- The rest of the chapter details the physical and mental torment Raskolnikov[^c7raskolnikov] experiences.



TODO: clean up grammar and spelling
## Part 1 Full Analysis
- Most of part 1 (chapters 1-6) sets the tone and moral climate of Raskolnikov's world. It's a gray, bleak depiction of 19th-century Russian society rife with poverty, humiliation, and transactional human relationships. Most of the characters introduced are enduring some form of suffering (see Marmeladov's story, Dunya's story, Alyona's story) that fuel Raskolnikov's ideology — the world is so morally bankrupt that someone has to take extraordinary action and rise above it. His extraordinary man theory[^gemt] begins to take shape. This theory is not just based on society's problems, it's also deeply emotional and reflects his ego, pride, and isolation (the author went out of his way several times to emphasize the antisocial nature of Raskolnikov's character such as purposely avoiding people, etc). Raskolnikov develops from a timid, nervous, soft-spoken ideologue into an angrier bitter person who has more (is manic the right word?) outbursts (see chapter 4 where he mocks the police officer).
- At the end of part 1 (chapter 7), Raskolnikov's theorizing meets the ugly weight of reality. His detailed plan to murder Alyona, the pawnbroker, was not as clean and swift as he imagined. It was chaotic and sloppy and ended in tragedy with Alyona's sister, Lizaveta, being murdered too — which was outside the bounds of his moral framework. The rest of the chapter details the extreme guilt he feels. The physical and mental torment Raskolnikov experiences is just the beginning of his punishment.
- Part 1 is the build up to, and including, the crime then ends at the early stages of guilt and punishment.
